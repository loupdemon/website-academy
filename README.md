### Guide for commit messages

We use [commit lint](https://conventional-changelog.github.io/commitlint/#/) in order to have a standard for commit messages. So if you create or update the content of a blog post, please use the `docs` type in your commit message, for example a commit message like `docs: new "post title"` is ok.

Also we use the `docs` type in our commit messages, to show a change history of every post (see `<History/>` component in `posts/template.js`).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run develop
```

Your site will run at `http://localhost:8000`!

> Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.

### Some notes..üßê

We highly recommend that you install the recommended extensions if you use VS Code. It will make your development sweet üç∞

### Resources

This project use Gatsby. See more of it in its awesome[tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql), it has very useful resources not only to learn Gatsby but also GraphQL, React & plugins for any purpose...

If you don't know MDX, well it's just markdown & with JSX. So you could import components if you needed.
